## Implementations the Basics from the Scatch
This repo contains the implementations for following basic building blocks of ML from the scratch (Just only using Python and Numpy),
 * Implementation of KNN (in `knn.ipynb`)
 * Implementation of Softmax classifier (in `softmax.ipynb`)
 * Implementation of SVM classifier (in `svm.ipynb`)
 * Implementation of optimization algorithms such as, (in `cs231n/optim.py`)
     1. Stochastic Gradient Descent
     2. Gradient Descent with Momentum 
     3. RMSProp
     4. Adam
 * Implementation of a simple two layer fully connected NN with backprop (in `two_layer_net.ipynb`)
 
 Note: All of above are developed for the assignments of cs231n, which is offered by Stanford. https://cs231n.github.io
